# ElemStatsLabManual
This is an OER (open educational resource) lab manual for PSYC 301: Elementary Statistics for Psychology at Texas A&M University. It is currently incomplete, but will be complete some time during the Fall 2020 semester. Before that time comes, it is ill-advised to fork this repository.
