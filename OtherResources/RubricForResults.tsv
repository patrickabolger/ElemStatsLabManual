25%	Organization	A. begins with a one-paragraph summary of the two analyses and what kind of statistics were used to address them (i.e., either a *t*-test and an ANOVA [Study 1] or a correlation and regression [Study 2]);  ***B. separate statistical analyses are presented in different paragraphs (in Study 1, three paragraphs: one for the t-test, one for the oneway ANOVA, and one for the post-hoc tests associated with the ANOVA; in Study 2, two paragraphs: one for the correlation and one for the regression)***;  C. direct reference is made to the relevant table(s) or figure(s);  ***D. at the end of each analysis, in the same paragraph, there is a 1-2 sentence summary of the results of that analysis***;  E. the prose can be read as straightforward sentences if a reader mentally deletes the descriptive and inferential statistics.	`5`	`3-4`	`1-2`	`0`
12.5%	**All** Inferential Statistics	A. the sampling distribution of the test statistic and the degrees of freedom are both presented correctly (respectively, as an italicized letter followed by or two numbers in parentheses, which are not italicized);  ***B. the obtained value is presented after the first equals (=) sign, rounded to two or three decimal places***;  C. the letter *p* (in italics) is provided after a comma, which itself is just to the right of the obtained value;  ***D. the letter p is followed by one of the following: (1) an equals sign [=] and then an exact p-value, or (2) either a greater-than [>] or less-than [<] symbol followed by the alpha level***;  E. following the *p*-value and a comma (and if available), the relevant effect size for the test statistic is provided (e.g., Cohen's *d*, eta-squared, etc.) [if not available, as is the case for both correlation and regression in Study 2, count this as 1];  ***F. following the effect size and a comma is a confidence interval (if available), reported as follows: CI 95% [lower bound, upper bound ], where the lower- and upper-bounds are actually numbers [if not available, count this as 1]***. 	`6`	`4-5`	`2-3`	`0-1`
12.5%	**All** Descriptive Statistics	A. For each group in Study 1, the mean is provided using the letter *M* (in italics) followed by an equals sign and the mean for that group, rounded to up to two decimal places (For Study 2, the relevant descriptive statistics are the Pearson's *r* value itself for the correlation, and the beta values [b] for the regression, which are both reported in the inferential statistics already, so count this as one if they are reported there);  ***B. For each group In Study 1, the standard deviation is provided using the letters SD (in italics) followed by an equals sign and the standard deviation for that group, rounded to up to two decimal places (For Study 2, the relevant descriptive statistic for regression is the standard error, or SE in jamovi [for both the intercept and the slope], with no equivalent [at least no in jamovi] for correlation)***;  C. For each group in Study 1, the sample is provided using the letter *n* (in italics) followed by an equals sign and the number of participants for that group, expressed as an integer (For Study 2, there is only one *N* value).	`3`	`2`	`1`	`0`
25%	Tables/Figures	A. a relevant table or figure is provided for ***each*** statistical analysis (post-hoc tests do not count as analyses here);  ***B. above each table or figure is a caption that starts with either the label Table (if it's a table) or Figure (if it's a figure), in boldface***;  C. below the **Table** or **Figure** label is a description of the table or figure in italics;  ***D. the description of the table or figure is concise, but adequately describes what is in that table or figure***.	`4`	`3`	`2`	`0-1`
25%	Language and style	A. Formal style (no use of informal language, like slang, or colloquial expressions);  ***B. Plain style (not ornate) with simpler vs. complex sentences***;  C. Paragraphs transition easily into each other;  ***D. Ideas are presented coherently***;  E. Sentences are cohesive (pronoun references are clear, etc.).	`5`	`3-4`	`1-2`	`0`
