5%	The opening	The opening sentence is general (and perhaps even commonplace), but clearly related to the topic funnel that follows.	The opening sentence is general (and perhaps even commonplace), but it is mostly related to the topic funnel that follows.	The opening sentence is general (and perhaps even commonplace), but it is only distantly related to the topic funnel that follows.	There is no general, opening statement. The writer starts abruptly by delving straight into the topic funnel in a fairly specific manner.
50%	The topic funnel	The topic starts as more specific than the opening, and ends as more general than whatever section immediately follows it (e.g., gap, methods summary, research question, etc.). In between, it proceeds naturally in a general-to-specific direction.	The topic starts just as general as the opening, and/or ends as only slightly more general than the section immediately follows it (e.g., gap, methods summary, research question, etc.). In between, it proceeds in a general-to-specific direction, but the progression seems a little unnatural or awkward at times.	The topic starts just as general as the opening and/or end just as specific as whatever section immediately follows it (e.g., gap, methods summary, research question, etc.). In between, it may proceed in only a vaguely general-to-specific direction.	The topic actually either starts a more general than the opening, or ends as more specific than whatever section immediately follows it (e.g., gap, methods summary, research question, etc.). Or in between, it proceeds in an unorganized way.
10%	The research gap	After the main body, but before any of the sections that are supposed to follow it (e.g., the method summary, research question, etc.), the author identifies a gap in knowledge that proceeds naturally from the paragraphs that preceded it.	After the main body, but before any of the sections that are supposed to follow it (e.g., the method summary, research question, etc.), the author identifies a gap in knowledge, but the gap arises somewhat abruptly, given the paragraphs that preceded it.	The author identifies a gap in knowledge, but the gap arises somewhat abruptly and may be placed strangely, like after the brief review of the methods, or in the middle of the body somewhere.	There is either no gap in knowledge identified anywhere, or if there is one, it is not obvious to the reader.
5%	The method summary	After identifying the research gap, the author included a brief and very clear outline of the methods that will be used to address the gap.	After identifying the research gap, the author included a brief and fairly clear outline of the methods that will be used to address the gap.	The author included a somewhat unclear outline of the methods that will be used. Or if the outline was clear, it was placed awkwardly, like after the research question, or before the identification of the gap.	The author also included nothing or very little about the methods that will be used. On the other hand, they may have written too much here, where much of what is written probably belongs in the Methods section.
15%	The research question/hypothesis	The Introduction ends with a precise well-reasoned, research question (and/or hypothesis) that clearly fills the gap in knowledge identified above it. Appropriate predictions are made.	The Introduction ends with a precise, but slightly less than perfectly reasoned research question (and/or hypothesis) that mostly fills the gap in knowledge identified above it. Predictions are made, but they may not be perfectly well thought out.	The Introduction ends with a research question (and/or hypothesis), but it is not very precise or well-reasoned that somewhat fills the gap in knowledge identified above it.	The Introduction does not end with a clear research question (and/or hypothesis).
5%	The meaning	The introduction ends with an explicit, clear, and relatively sober (i.e., slightly understated) statement about the wider meaningfulness of the study.	The introduction ends with an explicit, and clear statement about the wider meaningfulness of the study. But the meaningfulness might be slightly exaggerated.	The introduction ends with an explicit statement about the wider meaningfulness of the study. But the meaningfulness might be somewhat unclear or slightly exaggerated. Alternatively, it appears not at the end, but rather earlier.	The wider meaningfulness of the study may not be stated at all, or if it is, it is not at all justified given the nature of the study.
10%	Language and style	The writing is informal academic style, yet retains simplicity in expression. Transitions are always clear between paragraphs. And the ordering of sentences within paragraphs is always coherent, and cohesive.	The writing is in formal academic style, but sometimes gets too ornate and/or ambiguous. Transitions are usually clear between paragraphs. And the ordering of sentences within paragraphs is usually coherent, and cohesive.	The writing is in formal academic style, but gets too ornate or ambiguous. Transitions between paragraphs are usually unclear. Within paragraphs, sentence ordering is usually hard to follow, but careful readers can ultimately make sense of it.	The writing is too informal. There may be no clear transitions between paragraphs. It may be difficult to discern any sentence-ordering pattern within paragraphs; readers are left fatigued by the effort required to make sense of the ordering.
