30%	Synthesis	The information presented across the various Discussion sections is SUMMARIZED AND COMPARED (e.g., confirmation, disconfirmation, or lack of resolution) AS A SET, VERY CLEARLY to the highest-level predictions made at the end of the Introduction.	The information presented across the various Discussion sections is SUMMARIZED AND COMPARED (e.g., confirmation, disconfirmation, or lack of resolution) AS A SET, SOMEWHAT CLEARLY to the highest-level predictions in the Introduction.	The information presented across the various studies is LESS THAN CLEARLY SUMMARIZED AND/OR COMPARED, AS A SET to the highest-level predictions in the Introduction. They are treated separately, and not synthesized under one unifying idea somehow.	The information presented across the various Discussion sections is NEITHER SUMMARIZED NOR COMPARED AS A SET to the highest-level predictions from the Introduction.
30%	Clarification	The writing is EFFECTIVE in conveying how to interpret the current findings within EITHER the CURRENT OR the BROADER scientific context, OR BOTH.	The writing COULD HAVE BEEN MORE EFFECTIVE in conveying how to interpret the current findings within EITHER the CURRENT OR the BROADER scientific context, OR BOTH.	The writing WAS FAIRLY INEFFECTIVE in conveying how to interpret the current findings within EITHER the CURRENT OR the BROADER scientific context, OR BOTH.	The writing is DEVOID OF ANY ATTEMPT to convey how to interpret the current findings within EITHER the CURRENT OR the BROADER scientific context.
20%	Conclusion	The last few sentences are GENERAL and ILLUMINATING in nature, yet STILL QUITE WELL connected to the study at hand.	The last few sentences are GENERAL in nature, but COULD HAVE BEEN MORE ILLUMINATING. They are still WELL CONNECTED to the study at hand.	The last few sentences are MORE SPECIFIC in nature THAN THEY COULD HAVE BEEN, and COULD HAVE BEEN MORE ILLUMINATING.	The last few sentences seem like they are more like a CONTINUATION OF THE CLARIFICATION SECTION. In fact, there is little to indicate that there is a separate "Finalization" section at all.
20%	General language	The writing is formal, yet simple. Transitions are always clear between paragraphs. And the ordering of sentences within paragraphs is always coherent, and cohesive.	The writing is formal, but sometimes too ornate or ambiguous. Transitions are usually clear between paragraphs. the ordering of sentences within paragraphs is mostly coherent, and cohesive.	The writing is either too informal or gets too ornate or ambiguous. Transitions between paragraphs might be unclear. Within paragraphs, sentence ordering might be hard to follow, but careful readers can ultimately make sense of it.	The writing is too informal. There may be no clear transitions between paragraphs. It may be difficult to discern any sentence-ordering pattern within paragraphs; readers are left mentally fatigued by the effort required to make sense of the ordering.
