5%	Participants (basic)	ALL the basic statistics are included. These would include such statistics as the total count analyzed, counts per sex, and the mean and standard deviation of age.	MOST of the basic statistics are included, but ONE of the following is missing or under-reported: the total count analyzed, counts per sex, and the mean and standard deviation of age.	Most of the basic statistics are included, BUT MORE THAN ONE of the following is missing or under-reported: the total count analyzed, counts per sex, and the mean and standard deviation of age.	ALMOST NONE of the basic demographic information about participants is included.
10%	Participants (elaborated)	The descriptions here are FULLY detailed enough for an outside researcher to replicate the sample of participants.	The descriptions here are ALMOST detailed enough for an outside researcher to replicate the sample of participants, BUT AN IMPORTANT DETAIL SEEMS TO BE MISSING.	The descriptions here are NOT REALLY detailed enough for an outside researcher to replicate the sample of participants. MORE THAN ONE IMPORTANT DETAILS SEEM TO BE MISSING.	There is HARDLY ANY OR NO information here that would allow an outside researcher to replicate the participants in the study.
30%	Materials	This section is characterized by details of the instrument itself (e.g., survey questions, experimental trials) that are FULLY detailed enough to allow an outside researcher to create virtually the same instrument.	This section is characterized by details of the instrument itself (e.g., survey questions, experiment trials) that are ALMOST detailed enough to allow an outside researcher to create virtually the same instrument. However, ONE major element IS missing.	This section is characterized by details of the instrument itself (e.g., survey questions, experiment trials)  that are INSUFFICIENT to allow an outside researcher to create virtually the same instrument. MORE THAN ONE major element IS missing.	There is HARDLY ANY OR NO information here that would allow an outside researcher to replicate the instrument used in the study.
20%	Design	The following descriptions are FULLY detailed enough for another researcher to carry out the same data analysis (in jamovi): how the outcome and predictor variables relate; any data transformations; and any analyses of internal consistency.	The following descriptions are ALMOST detailed enough for another researcher to carry out the same data analysis (in jamovi): how the outcome and predictor variables relate; any data transformations; and any analyses of internal consistency.	The following descriptions are NOT REALLY detailed enough for another researcher to carry out the same data analysis (in jamovi): how the outcome and predictor variables relate; any data transformations; and any analyses of internal consistency.	There is HARDLY ANY OR NO information here that would allow an outside researcher to carry out the same data analysis.
25%	Procedure	This section describes the steps that both the researcher and participants took. Both are both FULLY detailed enough to allow an outside researcher to virtually re-create the same sequence of events for a new set of participants.	This section describes the steps that both the researcher and participants took. Both are both ALMOST detailed enough to allow an outside researcher to virtually re-create the same sequence of events for a new set of participants.	This section describes the steps that both the researcher and participants took. Both are both NOT REALLY detailed enough to allow an outside researcher to virtually re-create the same sequence of events for a new set of participants.	There is HARDLY ANY OR NO information here that would allow an outside researcher to replicate the same sequence of events for a new set of participants.
5%	Level of detail	The content is sufficiently detailed for replication, but not overly so.	The content provides a little too much detail.	The content clearly provides too much detail	The content is very seriously over-detailed.
5%	General language	The writing is formal, yet simple. Transitions are always clear between paragraphs. And the ordering of sentences within paragraphs is always coherent, and cohesive.	The writing is formal, but sometimes too ornate or ambiguous. Transitions are usually clear between paragraphs. the ordering of sentences within paragraphs is mostly coherent, and cohesive.	The writing is either too informal or gets too ornate or ambiguous. Transitions between paragraphs might be unclear. Within paragraphs, sentence ordering might be hard to follow, but careful readers can ultimately make sense of it.	The writing is too informal. There may be no clear transitions between paragraphs. It may be difficult to discern any sentence-ordering pattern within paragraphs; readers are left mentally fatigued by the effort required to make sense of the ordering.
